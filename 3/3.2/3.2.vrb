\frametitle{Partial Autocorrelation}

There might be a more useful model selection strategy than just checking where you think the ACF and PACF cut off. For example, if the true model is not a pure MA or AR, then this ``finding cutoffs" strategy is useless.

Now you have the computational tools to plot sample *and* theoretical ACFs and PACFS. Try more sophisticated strategies to match them up and pick a better model!
