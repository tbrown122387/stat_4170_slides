\frametitle{Method S2: Elimination of Trend and Seasonal Components
by Differencing}

If our model is
\[
X_t = m_t + s_t + Y_t,
\]
then
\[
\nabla_d X_t = m_t - m_{t-d} + Y_t - Y_{t-d}
\]
where $\nabla_d$ is the lag-d difference, (not $\nabla^d$!)
\newline

In R:
\begin{verbatim}
diff(logRets, lag=12)
\end{verbatim}

Note that $\nabla \nabla_d X_t = \nabla_d \nabla X_t$, but it's recommended that you apply $\nabla_d$ first (left side).
